## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running. If you already have the downloaded file, you can skip
the "clone repository".

### Clone repository 

    git clone https://github.com/JaydenKu03/MMU-FYP-System-PART2.git

### Note
- Create a database call "fyp_web" and import the sample_data.sql
